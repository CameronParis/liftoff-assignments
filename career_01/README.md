* GORM Data Services

### Description of Meetup
The presenter discussed GORM, formerly a part of Grails, but now available for standalone use with a variety of platforms. GORM(Groovy Object Relational Mapping) code is not bound to your database, and supports a number of query avenues, including dynamic finders, criteria, where statements, and HQL(Hibernate Query Language). One advantage of using GORM Data Services is defense against SQL injection. GORM Data Services was described as efficient because there is less code to write, it is compile time optimized, and it supports easy mocking.

### Questions
1. Q:What platforms can you use GORM with? A:Hibernate, MongoDB, and multiple JPAs, to name a few.
